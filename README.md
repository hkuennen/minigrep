# Minigrep

## Philosophy

The _minigrep_ project was inspired by the need for a simple, lightweight tool to search for text patterns in files. While full-featured tools like `grep` exist, building a minimal version from scratch is an excellent way to learn about the core concepts of file I/O, command-line arguments, and pattern matching in Rust.

This project, featured in the Official Rust Programming Book, emphasizes practical problem-solving and encourages developers to deepen their understanding of Rustâ€™s robust standard library and ownership model.

## Description

_Minigrep_ is a command-line application that searches for a specific string within a file and prints out matching lines. It is a simplified version of the Unix `grep` tool, implemented in Rust, and serves as a hands-on learning project for Rust beginners.

### Key Features:

- **Search functionality**: Users can specify the string they want to search for, along with the file to search in.
- **Case-insensitive search**: Supports case-insensitive searching through an optional environment variable.
- **Error handling**: Demonstrates robust error handling for invalid input or missing files.

### How it Works:

1. **Command-line arguments**: The program accepts two arguments:

   - The string to search for.
   - The file to search in.

   Example:

   ```bash
   cargo run -- "query" file.txt
   ```
